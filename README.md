 # Playwright Tests Project
This repository contains a collection of Playwright tests created as part of my personal practice to learn and master Playwright for end-to-end testing. Playwright is a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API.

## Tests
This project is a practice repository to help me learn Playwright by creating and running end-to-end tests. The tests cover various functionalities and scenarios to ensure a thorough understanding of Playwright's capabilities.
